# Building an AI Team of Professional Traders for HyperLiquid

*How we built a multi-agent trading system that works like a professional prop desk*

## The Problem with Traditional AI Trading Bots

Most AI trading systems suffer from a critical flaw: they're monolithic thinkers. They attempt to process market data, assess risk, execute trades, and monitor performance all within a single, overwhelmed AI model. It's like asking one person to be simultaneously a market analyst, risk manager, execution specialist, and portfolio manager.

### Common Pitfalls:
- **Rushed Decisions**: Making trades without comprehensive analysis
- **Conflicting Objectives**: Struggling to balance risk and return
- **Lack of Specialization**: One-size-fits-all approach to different market conditions
- **Black Box Decisions**: Limited explainability behind trading actions

## The Solution: A Team of Specialized AI Agents

Instead of a single AI model, we've built a team of specialized agents, each with distinct responsibilities and expertise, working together like a professional trading desk.

### Meet the Dream Team

#### 1. Market Analysis Agent
- **Specialty**: Technical and fundamental analysis
- **Responsibilities**: Real-time market sentiment analysis, pattern recognition, trend identification
- **Implementation**: Uses advanced LLMs to process news, social sentiment, and technical indicators

#### 2. Risk Assessment Agent
- **Specialty**: Portfolio risk management
- **Responsibilities**: Dynamic position sizing, correlation analysis, drawdown protection
- **Implementation**: Calculates optimal risk exposure based on market volatility and strategy confidence

#### 3. Trading Agent
- **Specialty**: Strategy execution and position management
- **Responsibilities**: Implements trading strategies, manages positions, generates orders
- **Implementation**: Processes signals, manages portfolio, and coordinates with execution

#### 4. Execution Agent
- **Specialty**: Trade execution efficiency
- **Responsibilities**: Order routing, timing optimization, slippage minimization
- **Implementation**: Implements smart order routing and execution algorithms

## Advanced Symbol Management

### Dynamic Symbol Configuration

We've implemented a robust symbol management system that automatically discovers and configures trading pairs from the Hyperliquid exchange:

```python
# Example of fetching and configuring symbols
async def fetch_available_symbols() -> List[str]:
    """Fetch all available trading symbols from Hyperliquid."""
    params = {'type': 'meta'}
    data = await self._make_request("/info", method='POST', data=params)
    return sorted([asset['name'].upper() for asset in data.get('universe', [])])
```

### Configuration Validation

All symbol configurations are validated against a strict JSON schema to ensure data integrity:

```json
{
  "symbols": {
    "BTC": {
      "enabled": true,
      "min_volume": 1000000,
      "max_volume": 100000000,
      "notes": "High liquidity pair"
    }
  },
  "default_settings": {
    "min_volume": 100000,
    "max_volume": 10000000,
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Real-time Monitoring Stack

We've implemented a comprehensive monitoring solution using:

1. **Prometheus + Grafana**
   - Tracks trading metrics in real-time
   - Custom dashboards for PnL, execution quality, and system health

2. **ELK Stack**
   - Centralized logging for all trading activities
   - Advanced log analysis and alerting

3. **Custom Health Checks**
   - Continuous validation of trading parameters
   - Automated detection of abnormal market conditions

### Key Metrics Tracked

| Metric | Description | Alert Threshold |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Order Execution Time | Time to fill orders | > 500ms |
| Slippage | Difference between expected and actual fill price | > 0.1% |
| API Latency | Exchange API response time | > 300ms |
| Position Risk | Current risk exposure | > 2% of portfolio |

## Technical Architecture

### System Overview

Our architecture follows a message-driven design where agents communicate asynchronously through a central message bus:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Market Data] --> B[Analysis Agent]
    B -->|Market Analysis| C[Trading Agent]
    C -->|Order Request| D[Risk Agent]
    D -->|Approval| E[Execution Agent]
    E -->|Execution| F[Exchange]
    F -->|Market Data| A
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Base Agent
```python
class BaseAgent:
    """Base class for all agents with common functionality."""
    
    def __init__(self, agent_id: str, message_bus: MessageBus):
        self.agent_id = agent_id
        self.message_bus = message_bus
        self.running = False
        
    async def start(self):
        """Start the agent's main loop."""
        self.running = True
        await self._setup_handlers()
        
    async def stop(self):
        """Gracefully stop the agent."""
        self.running = False
        
    async def _handle_message(self, message: Message):
        """Process incoming messages."""
        raise NotImplementedError
```

#### 2. Message Bus
```python
class MessageBus:
    """Handles message routing between agents."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.handlers = defaultdict(list)
        
    def subscribe(self, message_type: str, handler: Callable):
        """Subscribe to a message type."""
        self.handlers[message_type].append(handler)
        
    async def publish(self, message: Message):
        """Publish a message to all subscribers."""
        for handler in self.handlers.get(message.type, []):
            await handler(message)
```

## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Agent Communication
Agents communicate using a structured message format:

```python
@dataclass
class Message:
    """Standard message format for inter-agent communication."""
    type: str  # e.g., "MARKET_DATA", "TRADE_SIGNAL", "ORDER_REQUEST"
    sender: str
    payload: Dict[str, Any]
    timestamp: float = field(default_factory=time.time)
```

### 2. Risk Management
```python
class RiskAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Manages risk assessment and position sizing."""
    
    def __init__(self, max_position_size: float = 0.1, max_risk_per_trade: float = 0.02, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.max_position_size = Decimal(str(max_position_size))
        self.max_risk_per_trade = Decimal(str(max_risk_per_trade))
        
    async def assess_risk(self, signal: TradeSignal) -> RiskAssessment:
        """Assess risk for a potential trade."""
        # Calculate position size based on risk parameters
        account_value = await self._get_account_value()
        max_risk_amount = account_value * self.max_risk_per_trade
        
        # Calculate position size based on stop loss
        if signal.stop_loss:
            risk_per_unit = signal.entry_price - signal.stop_loss
            position_size = min(
                max_risk_amount / abs(risk_per_unit),
                account_value * self.max_position_size / signal.entry_price
            )
        else:
            position_size = account_value * self.max_position_size / signal.entry_price
            
        return RiskAssessment(
            approved=True,
            position_size=float(position_size),
            risk_score=0.0,  # Calculated based on various factors
            message="Risk assessment complete"
        )
```

### 3. Trading Strategy
```python
class MeanReversionStrategy:
    """Simple mean reversion strategy."""
    
    def __init__(self, lookback: int = 20, zscore_threshold: float = 2.0):
        self.lookback = lookback
        self.zscore_threshold = zscore_threshold
        
    def generate_signal(self, prices: List[float]) -> Optional[TradeSignal]:
        """Generate trading signals based on mean reversion."""
        if len(prices) < self.lookback:
            return None
            
        recent_prices = prices[-self.lookback:]
        current_price = recent_prices[-1]
        mean = np.mean(recent_prices)
        std = np.std(recent_prices)
        
        if std == 0:
            return None
            
        zscore = (current_price - mean) / std
        
        if zscore > self.zscore_threshold:
            return TradeSignal(
                symbol="BTC/USD",
                side="sell",
                entry_price=current_price,
                stop_loss=current_price * 1.02,  # 2% stop loss
                take_profit=mean,  # Target the mean
                confidence=min(0.9, abs(zscore) / 3)  # Scale confidence with z-score
            )
        elif zscore < -self.zscore_threshold:
            return TradeSignal(
                symbol="BTC/USD",
                side="buy",
                entry_price=current_price,
                stop_loss=current_price * 0.98,  # 2% stop loss
                take_profit=mean,  # Target the mean
                confidence=min(0.9, abs(zscore) / 3)
            )
        return None
```

## Performance and Results

### Backtesting
We've implemented a backtesting framework that allows us to evaluate the performance of our multi-agent system:

```python
class BacktestRunner:
    """Runs backtests for the trading system."""
    
    def __init__(self, initial_balance: float = 10000.0):
        self.initial_balance = initial_balance
        self.agents = {
            'analysis': AnalysisAgent(),
            'trading': TradingAgent(),
            'risk': RiskAgent(),
            'execution': ExecutionAgent()
        }
        
    async def run(self, historical_data: pd.DataFrame):
        """Run backtest on historical data."""
        # Initialize agents
        for agent in self.agents.values():
            await agent.start()
            
        # Process each bar of historical data
        for idx, bar in historical_data.iterrows():
            # Update market data
            market_data = MarketData.from_bar(bar)
            await self.message_bus.publish(Message(
                type="MARKET_DATA",
                sender="backtest",
                payload={"data": market_data}
            ))
            
            # Let agents process the data
            for agent in self.agents.values():
                await agent.process()
                
        # Generate performance report
        return self._generate_report()
```
